# Image Processing Tool with OpenCV, Streamlit, and EasyOCR

This project is an **Image Processing Tool** that leverages **OpenCV**, **Streamlit**, and **EasyOCR** to offer various image processing features. With this tool, users can enhance images by performing operations like sharpening, smoothening, denoising, contrast & brightness adjustment, and histogram equalization. Additionally, the tool includes **text extraction** capabilities using the **EasyOCR** library.

## Features

- **Sharpening**: Enhance the edges and details in the image.
- **Smoothening**: Reduce image noise and smooth out details.
- **Denoising**: Remove unwanted noise from the image using advanced denoising techniques.
- **Contrast & Brightness Adjustment**: Adjust the overall contrast and brightness of the image to improve visibility.
- **Histogram Equalization**: Improve the contrast of the image, especially for poorly lit images.
- **Text Extraction**: Extract text from images using the **EasyOCR** library.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **OpenCV**: For various image processing tasks (sharpening, smoothening, denoising, etc.)
- **Streamlit**: For building the user interface.
- **EasyOCR**: For optical character recognition (OCR) and text extraction.
